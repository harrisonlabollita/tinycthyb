# tinycthyb

This is C++ implementation based entirely on another educational implementation [example]().

This was an educational exercise for myself to leanr more about the CT-QMC algorithm as well as C++.

## CT-HYB
A few words on the algorithm.

## Build
To build the project (after installing the dependencies),

1. ``git clone https://github.com/harrisonlabollita/tinycthyb.git``
2. ``cd tinycthyb``
3. ``mkdir build && cd build``
4. ``cmake ../src``
5. ``make``

## Dependencies

For the array library, I have used [TRIQS/nda]().
